# Session 4


This is the README for session4 - Numerics Part 2.


This file contains information present in `session4.py` file and the test cases in `test_session4.py`.


## session4.py

The functions are - 


```
class Qualean:
    """
    This is a Qualean class inspired by Boolean + Quantum
    concepts.
    """
```
The state is set using a real number (-1, 0, 1). This number is then multiplied with a random 
number sampled from a unifrorm distribution.

### __add__()

This method adds two objects.

### __eq__()

This method return a bool be comparing 2 objects. If equal, `True` is returned. Else, `False`. 

### ___float__()
This method converts Qualean object to float.


### __ge__()
This mehtod compares if a Qualean object is greater than or equal to another object.

### __gt__()
This method compares if a Qualean object is greater than another object.

### __le__(self, value):
This method compares if a Qualean object is less than or equal to  another object.

### __lt__()
This method compares if a Qualean object is less than another object.

### __mul__()
This method multiplies 2 Qualean objects.

### __invertsign__()
Inverts the sign of a Qualean object.


###  __sqrt__()
Calculate aquare root of a qualean object.

### __bool__()
Calculate boolean value of a qualean object.

### __repr__()
Repr of class.


### __str__()
Str of class. 

### __and__()
`and` bool implementation for 2 objects.

### __or__()
`or` bool implementation for 2 objects.
